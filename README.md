Idea to use arrows and enter key as a means of selecting tiles (using ActionListner):
{
if (*event variable* == *up arrow* && y - 1 > 0)
	*cursor moves up*
if (*event variable* == *down arrow* && y + 1 < *max tile height*)
	*cursor moves down*
if (*event variable* == *left arrow* && x - 1 > 0)
	*cursor moves left*
if (*event variable* == *right arrow* && x + 1 < *max tile height*)
	*cursor moves right*
}

Move option (in menu, when Unit is clicked):
exit menu, show movement distance, move to clicked tile.

Unit's stat array: [level, life, attack, defense, speed, spirit (used for magic stuff), critical hit chance, tiles able to move, whether or not the unit can fly]

To hit: Atk (of attacking Unit) > Def (of defending Unit).

Damage: Weapon damage. x2 if "super effective" (i.e. Bow-class weapon vs flying unit). x2 if Speed (of attacker) > Def (of defender). x2 for critical (Crit stat > random number from 1 - 100).
